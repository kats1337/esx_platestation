# esx_platestation
Script that adds possibility to have custom licenseplates!

# Configurable in several different ways through config file

# Multiple spots at once, just add them to your config!

# Ensure that your `owned_vehicles` SQL table has "owner" and "plate" columns! Otherwise you'd have to edit the `plate_sv.lua` for the script to work!
